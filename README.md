1. Create a public static method called **ascending** that takes in an `array` and that returns an `array`. Return the
   `array` that was made in ascending order.

2. Create a public static method called **countWords** that takes in a `string` and returns how many words are inside that `string`

3. Create a public static method called **Calculator** that takes in two numbers and a mathematical operator + - / * and will perform a calculation with the given numbers

4. Create a public static method called **cardHidden** that takes a credit card number as a `string` and only displays the last four characters. The rest of the card number must be replaced by ************.

5. Create a public static method called **reverseOdd** that given a `string`, reverse all the words which have odd length. The even length words are not changed

6. Create a package called **bigDinner**. Inside **bigDinner** create a class called **dinnerApp** where your main method will be in order to test the following questions

7. Inside **bigDinner** create a new class called **Dinner**. Make instance fields that can't be accessed outside Dinner. These fields should be of type `String` named `appetizer`, `drink`, `side`, `meal`, and `dessert`. Create a constructor that sets the `appetizer`, `drink`, `side`, `meal`, and `dessert`. Write getters and setters for each property.

8. Create an interface named **Sentence** inside **bigDinner**
    - Specify an instance method named `myDinner` that accepts no arguments and returns a `String`.


9. Change your **Dinner** class so that it implements the **Sentence** interface.
    - The implementation of the `myDinner` method on Dinner class should return the following message:
      ```
      WOW! You have appetizer, meal, side, drink, and a dessert to top it off? That's one big dinner!
      ```

    - Remember to replace the instance properties of `appetizer`, `drink`, `side`, `meal`, and `dessert` to display the assigned values.

10. Inside **dinnerApp** create a new instance of **Dinner** and make your new instance of **Dinner** use the **Sentence** interface# Oberon-Java-Asessment-Prep-Day2# Sirius-java-assessment-prep-v2
